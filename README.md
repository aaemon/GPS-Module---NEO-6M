# GPS-Module---NEO-6M
Receive the GPS signal using Arduino and NEO-6M GPS Module.
The module takes about a minute to find the satellites to connect for the first time. Wait until the light on the module changes states. The signal is receives and can be monitored in the Serial monitor, also the calculated position vector of the current location is shown in the serial monitor. Ask any questions, I will help.
